# Airport Managing System
This was the project I developed for the Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures course at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico in the school year 2021/2022. A C program that simulates an airport managing system, keeping track of airports, dates, flights and reservations.

The project was mostly written in Portuguese.
